      "text": "\"Hello @nihal467 @khavinshankar, just wanted to inform you that I've successfully set up both CITIZEN and CARE projects locally. I'm considering beginning the UI design process for CITIZEN, mirroring the style of CARE. Can I start? \r\n\r\nA brief introduction: My name is Manas, currently a second-year undergraduate student at IIT Guwahati. I have experience with MERN and NEXTJS technologies. Previously, I participated in an inter IIT competition where my team secured the 2nd position with a NEXTJS project. I'm eager to contribute to this project under your guidance. \r\n\r\nThank you!\""
