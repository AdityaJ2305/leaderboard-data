      "text": "Hello sir @rithviknishad ,\n\nI would like to take up this enhancement and contribute to improving the user experience.\n\nI plan to enhance the rendering logic for the patient address field in the profile view. Specifically, I will implement a check to determine whether the saved address begins with a valid URL scheme such as \"http://\" or \"https://\". If a valid URL is detected, it will be rendered as a clickable hyperlink using an anchor tag with target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to ensure security and open the link in a new tab. If the address does not contain a URL, it will continue to display as regular text.\n\nThis change will help users who paste links such as Google Maps URLs into the address field, making them directly accessible and improving overall usability without requiring manual copy-paste.\n\nExpected completion date: 29/06/2025\n\nPlease let me know if this approach works, and kindly assign the issue to me."
