      "text": "Hey, it seems a very nice idea, we can add a feature like spotlight search offered by ios , where we can type various tags and as one presses enter that particular tag would be selected, or even we can provide some custom inputs in the spotlight like \r\nfield:value pair tags,\r\n\r\nfor example  tags could be like:\r\n1. Search for : facilities / patients / assets\r\n2. location : Delhi/city"

      "text": "@sainak thanks for helping, I got your point. I am currently facing an issue in the issue, if we want to differentiate between the tabs which on the basis of data if they contain or not then we may have to fetch all their corresponding data at once when the page loads, because the tabs are requesting for data when they are active.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me is it the way to solve the issue or there is some other method too for it?\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "Hi @aparnacoronasafe , i have a suggestion regarding the issue, you idea of fading the tabs with no patients is good but how would the user come to know about this feature until informed, instead the tabs already show occupancy and if there are no patients then occupancy is by default zero and hence I think we can give all these 0 occupancy tags a separate color or add certain fields in filters tags.\r\n\r\n"
