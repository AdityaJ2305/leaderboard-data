      "text": "@AdityaJ2305 @rithviknishad I would like to work on the issue\n\nProposed Solution:\n\n- Replace the native <select> in the user profile language selector with ShadCN's Select component to maintain consistency with the design system. This will involve importing ShadCN Select, updating the JSX structure, ensuring language switching still works via i18next, and preserving existing className props for styling.\n\nETA: 1 Day from assignment"
