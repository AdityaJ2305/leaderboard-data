I will update it.\r\nThanks for your help @rithviknishad "

I guess it is not worked in oru project thats why I am curious about it.\r\nI have finished everything. I just want to position these buttons dynamically when the screen size changes that why I added like this but it won't work. \r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/92790024/19136622-6473-4d26-b0c4-5043065005cd\r\n\r\n"
