      "text": "@rithviknishad \r\nIt is a valid change as patients' condition changes the dose and frequency of the medication has to be changed for the same medicine. For example , an antibiotic is given to a critical patient in an 8th hourly manner but as the patient's condition improves, the frequency goes down to twice daily. so if we can have the feature to do that it'll be very helpful.( this feedback is from the nurses and doctors)"
